This is an introduction to Abstract Reduction Systems. 

The way I see it, a basic ARS is a set of rules that converts expressions until it can be reduced to a smaller expression, and we examine the expression from left to right with these rules. 

For example, if we have a set that contains the variables {a, b, c, d} with the following rules:

aa -> b
bc -> d
ca -> ab
d -> []

and we have the string abcaa, we can reduce it to: abcb -> adb -> ab

Since there are no rules that can reduce ab to something else, we have reduced abcaa to the smallest possible value and the ARS terminates here. 

In the next blog, we will talk about normal/confluent forms, and how an ARS will be able to terminate
